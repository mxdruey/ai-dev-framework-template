## üß™ Testing Your Contributions

### Manual Testing

1. **Template Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Test with Claude Desktop planning phase
   # Create a real PRD using your template
   # Verify it produces useful, actionable documents
   ```

2. **Configuration Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Test with Claude Code implementation phase
   # Use your CLAUDE.md configuration
   # Verify Claude Code produces good results
   ```

3. **Setup Script Changes**:
   ```bash
   # Test all project types
   ./scripts/setup-project.sh  # Simple
   ./scripts/setup-project.sh  # Medium  
   ./scripts/setup-project.sh  # Complex
   ./scripts/setup-project.sh  # Agentic AI
   ```

### Integration Testing

1. **End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Use your changes to plan a real project with Claude Desktop
   - Implement the project using Claude Code
   - Document any issues or improvements needed

2. **Cross-Platform Testing**:
