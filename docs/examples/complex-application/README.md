2. **API Gateway**: GraphQL Federation for unified API
3. **Event-Driven**: Event sourcing for order management
4. **CQRS**: Separate read/write models for catalog
5. **Service Mesh**: Istio for observability and security
6. **Multi-Database**: Right tool for each service's needs

## Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Focus**: Core infrastructure and development environment

```bash
# Infrastructure setup
claude "Set up Kubernetes cluster with Istio service mesh. Configure namespaces for dev, staging, and production environments."

# CI/CD pipeline
claude --continue "Implement GitOps workflow with ArgoCD. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and building."

# Monitoring stack

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Framework Structure**: Clear separation of planning and implementation phases prevented scope creep
2. **Task Granularity**: Breaking down into 156 specific tasks made progress trackable
3. **Service Boundaries**: Domain-driven design resulted in clean, maintainable services
4. **Monitoring First**: Early monitoring setup caught issues before production
5. **Progressive Complexity**: Starting with core services before advanced features

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Service Communication Complexity**
   - Challenge: Managing inter-service dependencies
   - Solution: Event-driven architecture with clear contracts

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Challenge: Maintaining consistency across microservices
   - Solution: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

3. **Performance at Scale**
   - Challenge: Initial latency issues under load
   - Solution: Strategic caching and database optimization

4. **Team Coordination**

### Framework Enhancements Made

Based on this project, we enhanced the framework with:
- Microservices-specific task templates
- Distributed system architecture patterns
- Performance testing task templates
- Security compliance checklists

## Key Metrics

### Development Efficiency
- **Planning Time**: 3 days with Claude Desktop
