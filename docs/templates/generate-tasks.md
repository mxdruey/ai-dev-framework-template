# Task Generation Framework

## Goal
Convert a comprehensive PRD into actionable implementation tasks optimized for Claude Code execution, with clear dependencies, acceptance criteria, and quality gates.

## Process

### Step 1: Analyze PRD
Thoroughly read and understand:
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Technical Requirements**: How it should be built
- **User Stories**: User workflows and experiences
- **Success Criteria**: How to measure completion
- **Implementation Notes**: Specific guidance for Claude Code

### Step 2: Determine Implementation Approach
Based on PRD complexity, choose approach:
- **Simple**: Linear task sequence with basic quality gates
- **Medium**: Phased approach with integration points
- **Complex**: Multi-phase with comprehensive architecture
- **Agentic AI**: Specialized patterns for AI agent systems

### Step 3: Create Task Structure
Generate `/docs/tasks-[feature-name].md` with this format:

```markdown
# Implementation Tasks: [Feature Name]

## Overview
- **Based on PRD**: `/docs/prd-[feature-name].md`
- **Estimated Timeline**: [duration based on complexity]
- **Complexity Level**: [Simple/Medium/Complex/Agentic AI]
- **Technology Stack**: [from PRD technical requirements]

## Claude Code Execution Strategy

### Sequential Execution (Recommended)
```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation
claude "Read /docs/prd-[feature].md and implement Task 1.1 following the specifications."
claude --continue "Move to Task 1.2, implementing data models as specified in PRD."

# Phase 2: Core Implementation  
claude --continue "Begin Phase 2 with Task 2.1, implementing core functionality."
claude --continue "Continue with Task 2.2, creating API endpoints per PRD requirements."

# Continue through all phases systematically
```

### Batch Processing (For Experienced Users)
```bash
# Process entire phase at once
claude "Read PRD and implement all Phase 1 tasks (1.1-1.2) following specifications."
claude --continue "Implement Phase 2 tasks (2.1-2.3) with comprehensive testing."
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Regular progress checks
claude --continue "Review completed tasks against PRD requirements and run all tests."

# Final optimization
claude --continue "Optimize implementation for performance and complete all documentation."
```

## Success Criteria

Implementation is complete when:
- [ ] All functional requirements from PRD implemented
- [ ] All user stories working as specified
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for business logic
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Ready for deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Task Dependencies Unclear**: Review PRD for requirement relationships
- **Performance Issues**: Refer to PRD performance requirements and optimize accordingly
- **Integration Failures**: Check external service documentation and API keys
- **Test Failures**: Verify implementation against PRD acceptance criteria
- **Scope Creep**: Refer back to PRD non-goals and boundaries

### When to Update This Document
- PRD requirements change significantly
- New technical constraints discovered
- Timeline adjustments needed
- Team feedback requires process changes
